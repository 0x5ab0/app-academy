# Getting Started at App Academy

## Learning at App Academy

This course contains five sections:

1. **Introduction, Welcome, and Setup**
2. **Basic HTML and CSS**
3. **Intermediate HTML and CSS**
4. **Basic Programming with JavaScript**
5. **Git Workflow and Developer Practices**

As you move through this prepwork and course curriculum, you will encounter some lessons that seem too easy and some that seem too hard.

If a lesson seems too hard:

- **Acknowledge the challenge**: First, take a step back and remind yourself why you are here (What are your goals? What will it take to accomplish them?). Next, develop your game plan (How will you set yourself up for success on the hard parts? Is your working environment free of distractions? Do you have all of the resources you might need to work on the lesson?). Then, plan ahead (How will you recognize when you are getting stuck? What does that look like and feel like to you? What will you do to reset and refocus once you hit the “stuck” point?)
- **Actively engage with the lesson**: When you are actively engaging, you are: 1. taking notes, 2. testing out code samples in the terminal, 3. asking questions and playing with code to find answers, 4. pausing to summarize what you just read or learned. When you are passively learning, you are: 1. reading or viewing a lesson in one shot without pausing, 2. skimming examples without trying them out yourself, 3. not asking any questions, 4. unable to summarize or explain.
- **Learn with others:** After exploring the content on your own, it can be helpful to start exploring the challenging content with others.

If a lesson seems too easy:

- **Focus on code style, conventions, and documentation**: Read through the lessons with a focus on the style and formatting of the code samples and the conventions that are demonstrated in the lesson. Dig into the documentation resources in each lesson to deepen your understanding. Focus your practice on making sure your code style is as clean as possible.
- **Explore multiple approaches**: Push yourself to explore how to solve the problems or accomplish the same goal using several different approaches. What are pros and cons of each approach, in terms of readability and efficiency? How can you improve your original solutions?
- **Teach others**: When you are feeling strong on a given topic, it is helpful to reinforce what you know by teaching others.

## Introduction to Problem Solving I

Throughout this prepwork and the course, you will inevitably get stuck on a problem from time to time. Remember these tips on how to ask a great question:

- **15 minute rule**: Ask a question if you've been stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes
- **Try it out in a REPL**: If you are curious/unsure about how a line of code will execute, try it out in a REPL
- **Take time formulating your question**: A good question is specific, clear, concise, and shows you put work into it
- **Use a search engine**: Look up your question to see if someone else asked a similar question to you and got an answer
- **Use official documentation**: Explore documentation like MDN ([Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/)) for questions about syntax or usage of an operation or function
- **Ask your peers**: Ask your formulated question to others in your field

The 4 steps to solve any problem:

1. **Understand the problem**: What is the problem asking you to do? Can you restate the problem in your own words? Do you understand all of the words in the problem? Do you have enough information to solve the problem? Are there any constraints or edge cases to consider?
2. **Make a plan**: Break the problem into smaller steps, draw it out, solve a simpler version of it, look for patterns, work backwards, guess and check...
3. **Carry out the plan**: Take your plan and drop it straight into your code via comments. Then, just translate the comments into code.
4. **Look back and improve your solution**: Once you've come up with a solution, it's always good to revisit your code and make improvements. Sometimes that means fixing bugs or testing edge cases. Sometimes it means optimizing your code for readability or efficiency.

If (and when) you get stuck, take a deep breath, and remember to take a step back, and you should be able to come to a solution.

Thinking like a programmer means knowing how to use web search and official documentation to find answers quickly. **[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)** is Mozilla's official collection of web development resources created and maintained by a community of active developers.
